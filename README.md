# Business Process Conclusion Prediction: Millenium BCP Case Study
Master's project for the Business Cases with Data Science course

### Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a business process conclusion prediction project at Millenium BCP. The study aims to predict the outcome of business process requests based on historical data, leveraging data science techniques to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

### Business Situation
#### Case Context
In modern organizations, effective process collaboration is essential. This case study focuses on understanding, analyzing, and predicting the outcomes of various business process requests at Millenium BCP. The objective is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of handling these requests using data-driven approaches.

The BPM Competence Center and Automation team at Millenium BCP have implemented a rapid process and case deployment solution. This system aims to streamline service management, improve request handling, and provide complete visibility and transparency of the processes

### Assignment
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to identify the relevant variables for predicting process outcomes.
2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Use appropriate machine learning models to predict the outcome of requests (e.g., whether a request will be rejected or executed without rejections).
   - Justify the choice of models and parameters based on business requirements and data characteristics.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model performance using suitable metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
4. **Business Insights:** Suggest actionable insights based on the model predictions and propose improvements for the business process.

### Challenges
The main challenges in this case study include:

1. **Process Changes:** Addressing the inconsistencies arising from changing processes.
2. **Outlier Management:** Identifying and managing outliers in the dataset.
3. **Administrative Closures:** Properly interpreting and handling administrative closures.
4. **Masked Data:** Working with masked data to ensure confidentiality while extracting useful information.
5. **Data Augmentation:** Determining additional data requirements to improve model accuracy.
